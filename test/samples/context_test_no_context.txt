so I just got back from lunch and I was thinking about what we discussed earlier you know the whole thing about whether we should switch frameworks or not and honestly I'm still on the fence about it like on one hand the new framework has some really nice features that would make our lives easier but on the other hand there's going to be a significant learning curve and migration cost and I'm not sure if the benefits outweigh the costs at this point maybe we should do a small proof of concept first just to see how difficult the migration would actually be before we commit to anything what do you think
