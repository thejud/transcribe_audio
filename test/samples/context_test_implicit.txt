this is about the new deployment pipeline we're building for the mobile app the one we discussed in yesterdays meeting so I've been thinking about the different approaches we could take here and um there's a few things that keep coming up first of all we need to consider the existing infrastructure because we can't just rip everything out and start over right we have to work within the context of what's already there the current build system is using Jenkins but I'm wondering if we should consider moving to GitHub Actions or maybe GitLab CI because they have better integration with our existing tools and the context of our discussion yesterday really highlighted how important it is to have a smooth developer experience I mean if the developers are fighting with the build system all the time then we're not going to get the adoption we need so ease of use has to be a primary consideration here along with reliability and speed of course but I think in this context the developer experience might actually be the most important factor
