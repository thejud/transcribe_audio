begin context project alpha Q4 planning meeting followup budget constraints and timeline adjustments end context alright so based on what we discussed in the meeting I think we need to seriously reconsider our timeline for project alpha um the budget constraints are really going to impact what we can deliver in Q4 and I don't think we've fully accounted for that yet like when you look at the numbers we're basically trying to do the same amount of work with about thirty percent less resources and that's just not realistic so I've been thinking about how we can adjust the scope to fit within our constraints maybe we need to push some features to Q1 or find ways to simplify what we're building I know nobody wants to hear that but given the context we're operating in I think it's better to deliver something solid rather than trying to do everything and failing to deliver quality work what do you all think about maybe breaking this into phases where we deliver the core functionality in Q4 and then add the nice to have features later when we have more budget to work with
