context AI programming Claude agents maintaining proper context in sessions okay so I've been thinking a lot about um how we handle context in these AI agent sessions right and it's really interesting because like when you're building these systems you have to think about context in multiple ways there's the context window which is like the technical limitation but then there's also the semantic context which is what we're actually talking about and trying to maintain across the conversation um I was reading this paper yesterday about context management in large language models and they were talking about how context isn't just about memory it's about understanding the relationships between different pieces of information and I think that's really key here because when we're building these agent systems we need to make sure that the context is preserved not just in terms of what was said but also in terms of what it means and how it relates to the overall goal of the session you know what I mean like the context provides the framework for understanding everything else that follows and without proper context management these systems just kind of fall apart they lose track of what they're supposed to be doing
